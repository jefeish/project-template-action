## Concept Details

### TL;DR

#### The goal of this action is to **`build a project board`** and `Cards` from scratch, using a template Yaml file!

This action strictly uses templates to create all of it's components. Project board `Issues` as well as `Cards`, must be based on a `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.

 :thinking: Why? ...This ensures a standardized process that provides consitency and reusablilty.

However, this approach requires that we have an `Issue Template` for every project card we create.
To be precise, you cannot provide project card  content information in the project template Yaml file, only references to `Issue Templates`.

> NOTE: Project Cards are created based on Issue Templates, the content only, not the Header information (assignees, label, etc.)
